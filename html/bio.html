        <p>Madison is a very active 5 year old who has Autism. She was diagnosed in 2017. Madison goes to public places and has a meltdown. 
            People look at her as she may need discipline, when this not the case at all. Madison has an overactive sensory system.  
            Madison has been attending school since she was 3 years old. 
            We took Madison to meet her new teacher on May 22nd. The Teacher was a blessing.</p>
